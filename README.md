# patchedex

This aspect of the tether website seeks to create and maintain a database of different patches. Currently the only operating part of this project is the Patcher API. 

The Patcher API takes an unfiltered picture of a patch and removes the background to show on a profile. It also compares that image through the AWS bucket and looks for patches that are the same variety of patch so as to sort them into distinct categories
